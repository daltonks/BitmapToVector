# BitmapToVector
This is a work in progress!

C# port of [Potrace](http://potrace.sourceforge.net/). Utilizes SkiaSharp for bitmap operations.

In this port, I aim to keep the syntax and comments as close to the C version as possible. This will help with the initial port as well as keeping up to date on any new Potrace versions. I only aim to use typical C# syntax in the public API.
